# Augmented ARC Datasets Structure

## On each of the datasets with different number of tasks, the following transformations have been applied:

| Dataset Size | Transformations Applied |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| 2,000 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping |
| 4,000 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping<br>- 2-level permutation |
| 5,715 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping<br>- 3-level permutation |
| 7,430 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping<br>- 4-level permutation |
| 9,145 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping<br>- 5-level permutation |
| 18,668,610 tasks | - 90 and 270 degrees rotation<br>- Horizontal and vertical flipping<br>- All possible permutations for each task |
